  This is a derivation of the usbsoftrock project hosted at code.google.com/p/softrock.

  The source was pulled from the svn repository there on 2012-02-26.

  The principle changes will be three new commands:

  set registers <reg0> <reg1> <reg2> <reg3> <reg4> <reg5>
  - a command for directly setting the Si570 registers.
    that doesn't appear to work.

  solutions
  - print the set of register values that tune the currently tuned
    frequency.
    that doesn't find the exact current register values among the set.

  tweak
  - get the current tuning registers, compute the frequency, and set the
    registers to the next solution that tunes the same frequency.

    Well, almost, the frequency tends to edge upwards for reasons as yet
    unknown.

 Other changes involved refactoring the functions that compute register values
 from frequencies and frequencies from register values, so these computations
 would all use the same logic.
