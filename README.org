  This is a derivation of the usbsoftrock project hosted at code.google.com/p/softrock.

  The source was pulled from the svn repository there on 2012-02-26.

  The principle changes are three new commands:

  set registers <reg0> <reg1> <reg2> <reg3> <reg4> <reg5>
  - a command for directly setting the Si570 registers.

  solutions
  - print the set of register values that tune the currently tuned
    frequency.

  tweak
  - get the current tuning registers, compute the frequency, and set the
    registers to the next solution that tunes the same frequency.

    The roundtrip for computing frequency from register values and new
    register values from frequency aren't exact inverses, so the frequency
    tends to edge upwards.

 Other changes involved refactoring the functions that compute register values
 from frequencies and frequencies from register values, so these computations
 would all use the same logic.
