  The principle changes are:

  set registers <reg0> <reg1> <reg2> <reg3> <reg4> <reg5>
  - a command for directly setting the Si570 registers.

  solutions <frequency in MHz>
  - print the set of register values that tune the specified frequency.

  tweak
  - get the current tuning registers, compute the frequency, and set the
    registers to the next solution that tunes the same frequency.
